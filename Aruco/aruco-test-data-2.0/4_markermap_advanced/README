This folder contains the necessary material to test an advanced example of marker map. In this case, the set of markers
are placed along the environment in unknown locations. Using the marker_mapper library (http://www.uco.es/investiga/grupos/ava/node/57/), we have 
determined the 3D location of the markers. As a result, the marker_mapper library has returned the file map2.yml. The map indicates the 3d position of the markers, expressed in meters. 

Then, this file can be used to locate the camera in the environment. To test the results, use

utils_markermap/aruco_test_markermap map2.mp4 map2.yml -c camera.yml  -pcd map2.pcd


As you'll see, the center of the reference system is marker 244. As a result, you will obtain the pcd file (use pcl_viewer program of Point Cloud Library) to visualize. An screenshot can be seen in
