This directorry contains files to test the markermap utils

Contents:
map.png:  image of the map 
map.pdf:  pdf version of the png image to be printed on A4 paper
map.yml:  marker map configuration file. Indicates the position of each marker. Must be provided to aruco
map.mp4: video showing the map 
camera.yml: calibration parameters of camera that recorded the video
map_screenshot.png: image showing the trajectory of the camera
map.pcd: point cloud library
The map has been generated using the following command line tool:

./utils_markermap/aruco_create_markermap 5:7 map.png map.yml -s 200 -t 0

It genereates the file map.png and map.yml. The first one is the image of the map. We have converted it into a
pdf file you can print. The second one is the map description. It indicates the position of each marker w.r.t to the center of the set.
The positions are expressed in pixels, since we do not know in advance the real size it will have once printed.

Print you board and use a measure to determine the real size of each marker. Then, you can test the sequence using


./utils_markermap/aruco_test_markermap map.mp4 map.yml -c camera.yml -s 0.03 [-pcd map.pcd]

The parameter -s is the size of the marker. camera.yml are the camera parmeters we have previously calibrated.


The final parameter is optional. If enabled, prints at the end a pcd file (Point Cloud Library) that you can visualize with
pcl_viewer. The file shows the 3D marker locations (in blue) along the the trajectory of the camera (in green). A snapshot of the result can be seen in map_screenshot.png.
